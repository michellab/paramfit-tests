Paramfit-test

Here I derived a kind of tutorial/test on Paramfit
I will try to reproduce the tetraalanine parameterization present in the paper
(10.1002/jcc.23775)
At the end we will have a working protocol to use for parametrization with
Paramfit (hopefully)

tetralanine/

Here I will develop all the script for the parametrization of a tetralanine
according to amber force field  ff99SB (oldff)
