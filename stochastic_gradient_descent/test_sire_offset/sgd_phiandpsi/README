Here I tried to fit  ff99SB (with phi and psi amplitudes = 0.0 ) to ff99SB (real one)  with stochastic graident descent
I took structures every 5 deg both for Phi and Psi  and with a total potential energy < 5 kcal/mol and I tried to fit them
The final multiplicity I want is 3
This improve a lot the final results
