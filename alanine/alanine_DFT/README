Here I am trying to paramerize alanine according to b3lyp level of theory

Folders:

1_inputfiles: starting point to create the initial conformation for QM optimization

2_quantum_extract: Here we esxtract the QM energies, Amber energies and the optimized coords 
	      from the QM output files

3_fit_offset: Necessary step to find the bes offset fit for QM and MM enegies

4_fit_amplitude: fitting of Phi and Psi amplitudes with Paramfit

5_simulation: With the new values here I am running 10 different indipendent NVT MD simulations
              for 100 ns each in order to evaluate a FE Ramachandran Plot in the end 

all_HF_jobs: all the raw Gaussian input/ouptut/submission files
