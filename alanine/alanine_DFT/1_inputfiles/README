How to use the folders:

- dihedral_scan.py : python script to create the inputfiles + submission script
                     for Gaussian calculations
- dihedral.dat : dat file with the phi and psi angles we want to modify


1) Create the input file for quantum calculation:

~/sire.app/bin/python dihedral_scan.py  topology/fit.prmtop topology/fit.rst7 dihedral.dat 15


2) The script will create a directory  called PhiPsi_1 (TODO) : 
-PhiPsi_1 : pair of phi and psi (given in dihedral.dat), subdivided as:

PhiPsi_1/Phi_angle/files_Psiangle

Where Phi_angle folder has the name of the Phi angle, kept fixed during the
calculation and Psiangle is  the value of Psi for each particular .gcrt file
Basides gcrt files we have also a submission bash script for slurm, in order
to run all the calculations on section6
The script create a local temporary directory for each file, thus be aware of the 
quota you have an make space ( for HF or DFT is ok, for MP2 you need  at least 200 
GB of space to comput eall the 576 structures)

e.g.

PhiPsi_1/180/structure_60.gcrt + stucture_60.sh

The logic here is to give Gaussian structure which are already scanned (so we
don't have to perform scan in Gaussian)
Thus I pass Gaussian coordiante file with Phi and Psi fixed and I convert them
into suitable gcrt files for quantum optimization

3) To submit all the simulations with a runme.sh or simple bash script
