Here I am trying to paramerize alanine phi and psi dihedrals with b3lyp 6- 31 G*

Folders:

1_inputfiles: starting point to create the initial conformation for QM optimization

2_quantum_extract: Here we esxtract the QM energies, Amber energies and the optimized coords 
	      from the QM output files

3_fitting: mdgx fitting of phi and psi dihedrals  starting with QM energies


simulation: With the new values here I am running 10 different indipendent NVT MD simulations
              for 100 ns each in order to evaluate a FE Ramachandran Plot in the end
