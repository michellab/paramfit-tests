#Usage:

1) Copy all the output folder  from gaussian simulation to quantum_outputs
2) mkdir crd_outputs   where all the output coordinates file will be written
3) in quanutm_output convert_gcrt.sh

```
bash convert_gcrt.sh
```
convert_gcrt.sh  will execute extract_crd.py  from all the output of gaussian

In output you will have:
-crd_outputs:  folders with rst7 files
-all.mdcrd  :  all the coordinates files from guassian merge onto one single mdcrdfile
               (necessary for Paramfit)
-amber_energies.dat: the molecular mechanics energies evaluated for each rst7 file
              with fit.prmtop topology
              For the evaluation we use paramfit
-quantum_energies.dat: all the quantum mechanical energies extract from gaussian output
              The units of the energies are Hartree (=627.59 kcal/mol)

-problem.dat: dat file with problematic output from Gaussian (i.e. not terminated normally)



For mgdx we need to convert all the crd output in netcdf format  thus:

bash netcdf_creator.sh

Actually is a draft so it needs to  be improved in order to be more general
(just  make  something like for f in  */ ; do cd $f for g in structure*  blablabla)
