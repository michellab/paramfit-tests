Here I am trying to parametrize capped-alanine charges with the IPolQ 
protocol
For charges, I think the best approach is to select only the most important
conformations
It is impossible at the moment goes up to 15 deg of scan (resulting in more than
500 conformations), since the QM job would be too demanding  (and too difficult
to be controlled)
