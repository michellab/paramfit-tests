Here we generate conformers

The conofmrations are generated with mdgx through the input file:
genconf.in

Here we have:

&files section : we declare top crd and the output file

&configs: here we tell mdgx what to do:

- GridSample  : A grid is defined and used to move desired dihedrals
IN this case 1@O1 1@C1 1@C2 1@O2  
             1@C1 1@C2 1@O2 1@HO2
The atom names are written in the top file
The 1 means the numbe rof the molecule, in this case we have just glycerol
Considering an aminoacide sequence we would have had 1, 2, 3, different  chains
The dihedrals can move between -180 to 180 
Check why we need to apply a restraint of 32.0 kcal/mol with a flat bottom half width of 10.0 and 30.0 deg
 
- Set: Set apply a restraint to the angles. In this way we are preventing to have
hydroxil groups pointing one another, which means having dipoles opposite one another (not a good conformation)
to do that a flat bottom restraint is applied :  the angles can move freely
between 120.0 - 60.0 = 60.0  
        120.0 + 60.0 = 180.0
otherwise the restraint kkicks in with a constant 32.0 kcal/mol

-Combine: combine reads the GridSample lines
If it is not present then the dihedral are scan one after the other
if we combine, this mean that we are scanning all together
For example: Phi = 0.0  Psi = 0.0, 10.0, 20.0, 30.0 ....
             Phi = 10.0 Psi = 0.0, 10.0, 20.0, 30.0 ....

-Count : how many conformations  you want ( 9 here ) 



to run everything: mdgx -O -i genconf.in
