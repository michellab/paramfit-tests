Here I am trying to paramerize alanine according to HF level of theory

Folders:

1_inputfiles: starting point to create the initial conformation for QM optimization

3_mp2_calculation: Here via extract_crd.py I create the input files for MP2 single points calculation.
	       I am using these files ten to extract the all.mdcrd file along with QM energies

4_fit_offset: Necessary step to find the bes offset fit for QM and MM enegies


simulation: With the new values here I am running 10 different indipendent NVT MD simulations
              for 100 ns each in order to evaluate a FE Ramachandran Plot in the end
