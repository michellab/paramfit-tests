#USAGE

HEre we are fitting Phi and Psi amplitued with respect to QM energies
We are using paramfit and to run  type

```
paramfit -i fit_dihedral.in -p topology/fit.prmtop -c ../2_quantum_outputs/all.mdcrd -q ../2_quantum_outputs/quantum_energies.dat > fit_dihedral.out

```
Paramfit will run a genetich alghorithm + a simplex 
As output a frcmod.frcmod file will be given and it has the new value for Phi and Psi
