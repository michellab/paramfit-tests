Here I am trying to parametrize alanine accordig to different LLS solver
(paramfit, mine, soon mgdx) with QM optimization at different level of
theory:

alanine_HF :
alanine optmized at HF/6-31 G 

alanine_DFT:
alanine optimized at b3lyp/6-31 G

alanine_MP2:
alanine optimized at b3lyp/6-31 G + MP2 single point calc. on optimized 
structures

All the optimization are performed on 576 structures, where I am scanning
both Phi and Psi every 15 deg
