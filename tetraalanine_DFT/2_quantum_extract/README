#Usage:

1) Copy all the output folder  from gaussian simulation to quantum_outputs
2) mkdir crd_outputs   where all the output coordinates file will be written
3) in quanutm_output run_crd.sh:  bash run_crd.sh
run_crd.sh will execute extract_crd.py  from all the output of gaussian
In output you will have:
-crd_outputs:  folders with rst7 files
-all.mdcrd  :  all the coordinates files from guassian merge onto one single mdcrdfile
               (necessary for Paramfit)
-amber_energies.dat: the molecular mechanics energies evaluated for each rst7 file
              with fit.prmtop topology
              For the evaluation we use paramfit
-quantum_energies.dat: all the quantum mechanical energies extract from gaussian output
              The units of the energies are Hartree (=627.59 kcal/mol)

-problem.dat: dat file with problematic output from Gaussian (i.e. not terminated normally)


Here we think to take all the structure except Phi=0 Psi=0 (since it's too high  in energy)
To see the adiabatic plot run:
ipython notebook Adiabatic_plot.ipynb
We are using 143 points, thus not so many points
later I will run a test to see the energy landscape from quanutm output with more structure


I take out from amber_energies, quantum_energies and all.mdcrd the first structure (phi=0 psi=0)
which is incorrect

I skipped structure 0 
I am testing initial amplitude and multiplicity and original parameters
