Usage
=======


Between amber ff99 and amber ff99SB there is an offset which must be calcualted (as an average)
with Paramfit. In this way we will be able to perform a LLS calculation in order to minimize
a merit function


```
paramfit -i fit_K.in -p ../1_inputfiles/input_scan/fit_topology/fit.prmtop -c ../1_inputfiles/energies/all_structures.mdcrd -q ../1_inputfiles/energies/energies_ff99SB.dat > fit_K.out
```

Here I create a new topology, which will be used as a scaffold for our calcualtion. 
This topology  "../1_inputfiles/energies/all_structures.mdcrd" has the ff99 parametrization
except for the dihedrals to fit. In that case I extended the multiplicity to 3 and (rather than
2 as default in ff99). The final value for Phi and Psi in this topology are:

value of Phi
C -N -CT-C     1     1.00000000    0.000  -1.0    SCEE=1.2 SCNB=2.0

value of Phi
C -N -CT-C     1     1.00000000    0.000  -2.0    SCEE=1.2 SCNB=2.0

value of Phi
C -N -CT-C     1     1.00000000    0.000   3.0    SCEE=1.2 SCNB=2.0

value of Psi
N -CT-C -N     1     1.00000000  180.000  -1.0    SCEE=1.2 SCNB=2.0

value of Psi
N -CT-C -N     1     1.00000000  180.000  -2.0    SCEE=1.2 SCNB=2.0

value of Psi
N -CT-C -N     1     1.00000000  180.000   3.0    SCEE=1.2 SCNB=2.0


From these amplitudes Paramfit will try to make a fit and hopefully the ff99SB terms should be recovered.
ff99SB terms are:

value of Phi
C -N -CT-C     1     0.00000000    0.000  -1.0    SCEE=1.2 SCNB=2.0

value of Phi
C -N -CT-C     1     0.27000000    0.000  -2.0    SCEE=1.2 SCNB=2.0

value of Phi
C -N -CT-C     1     0.42000000    0.000  -3.0    SCEE=1.2 SCNB=2.0

value of Phi
C -N -CT-C     1     0.00000000    0.000   4.0    SCEE=1.2 SCNB=2.0

value of Psi
N -CT-C -N     1     0.45000000  180.000  -1.0    SCEE=1.2 SCNB=2.0

value of Psi
N -CT-C -N     1     1.58000000  180.000  -2.0    SCEE=1.2 SCNB=2.0

value of Psi
N -CT-C -N     1     0.55000000  180.000  -3.0    SCEE=1.2 SCNB=2.0

value of Psi
N -CT-C -N     1     0.00000000    0.000   4.0    SCEE=1.2 SCNB=2.0


In ff99SB we have 4 multiplicities, but since the amplitudes are 0.0 as in the paper
I selected to fit only 3 multiplicities


Finally, the total number of structures that we are processing is 46
and the offset K is -1.223465 kcal/mol
