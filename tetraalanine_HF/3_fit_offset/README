Here we have to compute the offset between quantum energies and 
amber energies
This is done with paramfit through a job.in file

paramfit -i fit_K.in -p ../2_quantum_extract/fit.prmtop -c ../2_quantum_extract/all.mdcrd 
-q ../2_quantum_extract/quantum_energies.dat > fit_K.out


the final value for K is:


with  ipyhton notebook fit_K_amber.ipynb
the general agreement between quantum energy and amber energy can be seen
